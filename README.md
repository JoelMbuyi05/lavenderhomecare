# 🧪 Development Process

* The project began by analyzing the requirements of a professional home care website. I focused on creating a clean, modern layout with clear navigation and easily accessible service information.
* I started with the HTML skeleton, defining sections for hero, about, services, contact, and footer. Next, I applied TailwindCSS to design a fully responsive layout, using utility classes for spacing, colors, and typography.
* JavaScript handled interactive elements like the image slider, chat widget, and contact modal forms. EmailJS was integrated to handle form submissions, and Firebase was set up to support any dynamic or future data storage needs.
* I continuously tested the design across devices to ensure cross-browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness. Animations and scroll reveals were added to enhance user engagement while maintaining performance.
